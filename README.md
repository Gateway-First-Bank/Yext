# Yext

This repository stores the configuraton and custom typescript functions for the Yext platform. It is merely a backup and not a live connection to the platform.

Code is manually merged w/ Yext via the Yext CLI and not Github.

The custom typescript functions live here:
-platform
--plugin
---gatewayfunctions
